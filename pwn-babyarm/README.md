Just a baby kernel stack overflow challenge. The novelty is that there are few chals about aarch64 kernel exploit before.

This arm64 kernel is built with nokaslr, stack-protector, PXN. We can simply leak the canary cookie and do ROP to leverage privilege and return to user mode.

As for how to switch back to user mode, I use gadgets of `ret_to_user` below in arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:406

```
