# Flux query language in Grafana

Grafana supports Flux running on InfluxDB 1.8+. See [1.8 compatibility](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-go/#influxdb-18-api-compatibility) for more information and connection details.

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`              | The data source name. This is how you refer to the data source in panels and queries. We recommend something like `InfluxDB-Flux`.                                                                                                       |
| `Default`           | Default data source means that it will be pre-selected for new panels.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `URL`               | The HTTP protocol, IP address and port of your InfluxDB API. InfluxDB 2.0 API port is by default 8086.                                                                                                                                   |
| `Organization`      | The [Influx organization](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/organizations/) that will be used for Flux queries. This is also used to for the `v.organization` query macro.                                                             |
| `Token`             | The authentication token used for Flux queries. With Influx 2.0, use the [influx authentication token to function](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/security/tokens/create-token/). For influx 1.8, the token is `username:password`. |
| `Default bucket`    | (Optional) The [Influx bucket](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/organizations/buckets/) that will be used for the `v.defaultBucket` macro in Flux queries.                                                                            |
| `Min time interval` | (Optional) Refer to [Min time interval]({{< relref "#min-time-interval" >}}).                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Max series`        | (Optional) Limits the number of series/tables that Grafana processes. Lower this number to prevent abuse, and increase it if you have lots of small time series and not all are shown. Defaults to 1000.                                 |

## Min time interval

A lower limit for the auto group by time interval. Recommended to be set to write frequency, for example `1m` if your data is written every minute.
This option can also be overridden/configured in a dashboard panel under data source options. It's important to note that this value **needs** to be formatted as a
number followed by a valid time identifier, e.g. `1m` (1 minute) or `30s` (30 seconds). The following time identifiers are supported:

| Identifier | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `y`        | year        |
| `M`        | month       |
| `w`        | week        |
| `d`        | day         |
| `h`        | hour        |
| `m`        | minute      |
| `s`        | second      |
| `ms`       | millisecond |

You can use the [Flux query and scripting language](https://www.influxdata.com/products/flux/). Grafana's Flux query editor is a text editor for raw Flux queries with Macro support.

## Supported macros

The macros support copying and pasting from [Chronograf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/).

| Macro example      | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v.timeRangeStart` | Will be replaced by the start of the currently active time selection. For example, _2020-06-11T13:31:00Z_                                                                               |
| `v.timeRangeStop`  | Will be replaced by the end of the currently active time selection. For example, _2020-06-11T14:31:00Z_                                                                                 |
| `v.windowPeriod`   | Will be replaced with an interval string compatible with Flux that corresponds to Grafana's calculated interval based on the time range of the active time selection. For example, _5s_ |
| `v.defaultBucket`  | Will be replaced with the data source configuration's "Default Bucket" setting                                                                                                          |
| `v.organization`   | Will be replaced with the data source configuration's "Organization" setting                                                                                                            |

For example, the following query will be interpolated as the query that follows it, with interval and time period values changing according to active time selection\):

Grafana Flux query:

```flux
from(bucket: v.defaultBucket)
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "cpu" or r["_measurement"] == "swap")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "usage_system" or r["_field"] == "free")
  |> aggregateWindow(every: v.windowPeriod, fn: mean)
  |> yield(name: "mean")
```

Interpolated query send to Influx:

```flux
from(bucket: "grafana")
  |> range(start: 2020-06-11T13:59:07Z, stop: 2020-06-11T14:59:07Z)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "cpu" or r["_measurement"] == "swap")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "usage_system" or r["_field"] == "free")
  |> aggregateWindow(every: 2s, fn: mean)
  |> yield(name: "mean")
```

You can view the interpolated version of a query with the query inspector. For more information, refer to [Inspect a panel]({{< relref "../../panels/inspect-panel.md" >}}) and [Queries]({{< relref "../../panels/queries.md" >}}).
