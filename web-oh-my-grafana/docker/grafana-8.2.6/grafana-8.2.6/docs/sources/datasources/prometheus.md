# Prometheus data source

Grafana includes built-in support for Prometheus. This topic explains options, variables, querying, and other options specific to the Prometheus data source. Refer to [Add a data source]({{< relref "add-a-data-source.md" >}}) for instructions on how to add a data source to Grafana. Only users with the organization admin role can add data sources.

> **Note:** You can use [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/features/#cloud-logs) to avoid the overhead of installing, maintaining, and scaling your observability stack. The free forever plan includes Grafana, 10K Prometheus series, 50 GB logs, and more.[Create a free account to get started](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user?pg=docs-grafana-install&plcmt=in-text).

## Prometheus settings

To access Prometheus settings, hover your mouse over the **Configuration** (gear) icon, then click **Data Sources**, and then click the Prometheus data source.

| Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`                    | The data source name. This is how you refer to the data source in panels and queries.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Default`                 | Default data source that is pre-selected for new panels.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Url`                     | The URL of your Prometheus server, for example, `http://prometheus.example.org:9090`.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Access`                  | Server (default) = URL needs to be accessible from the Grafana backend/server, Browser = URL needs to be accessible from the browser. **Note**: Browser (direct) access is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.                                    |
| `Basic Auth`              | Enable basic authentication to the Prometheus data source.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `User`                    | User name for basic authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Password`                | Password for basic authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Scrape interval`         | Set this to the typical scrape and evaluation interval configured in Prometheus. Defaults to 15s.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `HTTP method`             | Use either POST or GET HTTP method to query your data source. POST is the recommended and pre-selected method as it allows bigger queries. Change this to GET if you have a Prometheus version older than 2.1 or if POST requests are restricted in your network. |
| `Disable metrics lookup`  | Checking this option will disable the metrics chooser and metric/label support in the query field's autocomplete. This helps if you have performance issues with bigger Prometheus instances.                                                                     |
| `Custom Query Parameters` | Add custom parameters to the Prometheus query URL. For example `timeout`, `partial_response`, `dedup`, or `max_source_resolution`. Multiple parameters should be concatenated together with an '&amp;'.                                                           |
| `Label name`              | Add the name of the field in the label object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `URL`                     | If the link is external, then enter the full link URL. You can interpolate the value from the field with `${__value.raw }` macro.                                                                                                                                 |
| `Internal link`           | Select if the link is internal or external. In the case of an internal link, a data source selector allows you to select the target data source. Supports tracing data sources only.                                                                              |

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Query expression`  | Prometheus query expression. For more information, refer to the [Prometheus documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/querying/basics/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Legend format`     | Controls the name of the time series, using name or pattern. For example, `{{hostname}}` is replaced by the label value for the label `hostname`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Step`              | Use 'Minimum' or 'Maximum' step mode to set the lower or upper bounds respectively on the interval between data points. For example, set "minimum 1h" to hint that measurements are not frequent (taken hourly). Use the 'Exact' step mode to set a precise interval between data points. `$__interval` and `$__rate_interval` are supported.                                                                                                                                              |
| `Resolution`        | `1/1` sets both the `$__interval` variable and the [`step` parameter of Prometheus range queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries) such that each pixel corresponds to one data point. For better performance, you can pick lower resolutions. `1/2` only retrieves a data point for every other pixel, and `1/10` retrieves one data point per 10 pixels. Both _Min time interval_ and _Step_ limit the final value of `$__interval` and `step`. |
| `Metric lookup`     | Search for metric names in this input field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Format as`         | You can switch between `Table` `Time series` or `Heatmap` options. The `Table` option works only in the Table panel. `Heatmap` displays metrics of the Histogram type on a Heatmap panel. Under the hood, it converts cumulative histograms to regular ones and sorts series by the bucket bound.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Instant`           | Perform an "instant" query to return only the latest value that Prometheus has scraped for the requested time series. Instant queries can return results much faster than normal range queries. Use them to look up label sets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Min time interval` | This value multiplied by the denominator from the _Resolution_ setting sets a lower limit to both the `$__interval` variable and the [`step` parameter of Prometheus range queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries). Defaults to _Scrape interval_ as specified in the data source options.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Exemplars`         | Run and show exemplars in the graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

> **Note:** Grafana modifies the request dates for queries to align them with the dynamically calculated step. This ensures consistent display of metrics data, but it can result in a small gap of data at the right edge of a graph.

#### Instant queries in dashboards

The Prometheus data source allows you to run "instant" queries, which query only the latest value.
You can visualize the results in a table panel to see all available labels of a timeseries.

Instant query results are made up only of one data point per series but can be shown in the graph panel with the help of [series overrides]({{< relref "../visualizations/graph-panel.md#series-overrides" >}}).
To show them in the graph as a latest value point, add a series override and select `Points > true`.
To show a horizontal line across the whole graph, add a series override and select `Transform > constant`.

> Support for constant series overrides is available from Grafana v6.4

| `Query expression` | Prometheus query expression, check out the [Prometheus documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/querying/basics/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Step`             | [`Step` parameter of Prometheus range queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries). Time units can be used here, for example: 5s, 1m, 3h, 1d, 1y. Default unit if no unit specified is `s` (seconds).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Query type`       | `Range`, `Instant`, or `Both`. When running **Range query**, the result of the query is displayed in graph and table. Instant query returns only the latest value that Prometheus has scraped for the requested time series and it is displayed in the table. When **Both** is selected, both instant query and range query is run. Result of range query is displayed in graph and the result of instant query is displayed in the table. |

### Metrics browser

The metrics browser allows you to quickly find metrics and select relevant labels to build basic queries.
When you open the browser you will see all available metrics and labels.
If supported by your Prometheus instance, each metric will show its HELP and TYPE as a tooltip.

{{< figure src="/static/img/docs/v8/prometheus_metrics_browser.png" class="docs-image--no-shadow" max-width="800px" caption="Screenshot of the metrics browser for Prometheus" >}}

When you select a metric, the browser narrows down the available labels to show only the ones applicable to the metric.
You can then select one or more labels for which the available label values are shown in lists in the bottom section.
Select one or more values for each label to tighten your query scope.

> **Note:** If you do not remember a metric name to start with, you can also select a few labels first, to narrow down the list and then find relevant label values.

All lists in the metrics browser have a search field above them to quickly filter for metrics or labels that match a certain string. The values section only has one search field. Its filtering applies to all labels to help you find values across labels once they have been selected, for example, among your labels `app`, `job`, `job_name` only one might with the value you are looking for.

Once you are satisfied with your query, click "Use query" to run the query. The button "Use as rate query" adds a `rate(...)[$__interval]` around your query to help write queries for counter metrics.
The "Validate selector" button will check with Prometheus how many time series are available for that selector.

#### Limitations

The metrics browser has a hard limit of 10,000 labels (keys) and 50,000 label values (including metric names). If your Prometheus instance returns more results, the browser will continue functioning. However, the result sets will be cut off above those maximum limits.

## Templating

Instead of hard-coding things like server, application and sensor name in your metric queries, you can use variables in their place.
Variables are shown as dropdown select boxes at the top of the dashboard. These dropdowns make it easy to change the data
being displayed in your dashboard.

Check out the [Templating]({{< relref "../variables/_index.md" >}}) documentation for an introduction to the templating feature and the different
types of template variables.

### Query variable

Variable of the type _Query_ allows you to query Prometheus for a list of metrics, labels or label values. The Prometheus data source plugin
provides the following functions you can use in the `Query` input field.

| Name                          | Description                                                             | Used API endpoints                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `label_names()`               | Returns a list of label names.                                          | /api/v1/labels                    |
| `label_values(label)`         | Returns a list of label values for the `label` in every metric.         | /api/v1/label/`label`/values      |
| `label_values(metric, label)` | Returns a list of label values for the `label` in the specified metric. | /api/v1/series                    |
| `metrics(metric)`             | Returns a list of metrics matching the specified `metric` regex.        | /api/v1/label/\_\_name\_\_/values |
| `query_result(query)`         | Returns a list of Prometheus query result for the `query`.              | /api/v1/query                     |

For details of what _metric names_, _label names_ and _label values_ are please refer to the [Prometheus documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels).

#### Using interval and range variables

> Support for `$__range`, `$__range_s` and `$__range_ms` only available from Grafana v5.3

You can use some global built-in variables in query variables, for example, `$__interval`, `$__interval_ms`, `$__range`, `$__range_s` and `$__range_ms`. See [Global built-in variables]({{< relref "../variables/variable-types/global-variables.md" >}}) for more information. They are convenient to use in conjunction with the `query_result` function when you need to filter variable queries since the `label_values` function doesn't support queries.

Make sure to set the variable's `refresh` trigger to be `On Time Range Change` to get the correct instances when changing the time range on the dashboard.

**Example usage:**

Populate a variable with the busiest 5 request instances based on average QPS over the time range shown in the dashboard:

```
Query: query_result(topk(5, sum(rate(http_requests_total[$__range])) by (instance)))
Regex: /"([^"]+)"/
```

Populate a variable with the instances having a certain state over the time range shown in the dashboard, using `$__range_s`:

```
Query: query_result(max_over_time(<metric>[${__range_s}s]) != <state>)
Regex:
```

### Using `$__rate_interval`

> **Note:** Available in Grafana 7.2 and above

`$__rate_interval` is the recommended interval to use in the `rate` and `increase` functions. It will "just work" in most cases, avoiding most of the pitfalls that can occur when using a fixed interval or `$__interval`.

```
OK:       rate(http_requests_total[5m])
Better:   rate(http_requests_total[$__rate_interval])
```

Details: `$__rate_interval` is defined as max(`$__interval` + _Scrape interval_, 4 \* _Scrape interval_), where _Scrape interval_ is the Min step setting (AKA query*interval, a setting per PromQL query) if any is set. Otherwise, the Scrape interval setting in the Prometheus data source is used. (The Min interval setting in the panel is modified by the resolution setting and therefore doesn't have any effect on \_Scrape interval*.) [This article](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/09/28/new-in-grafana-7.2-__rate_interval-for-prometheus-rate-queries-that-just-work/) contains additional details.

### Using variables in queries

There are two syntaxes:

- `$<varname>` Example: rate(http_requests_total{job=~"\$job"}[5m])
- `[[varname]]` Example: rate(http_requests_total{job=~"[[job]]"}[5m])

Why two ways? The first syntax is easier to read and write but does not allow you to use a variable in the middle of a word. When the _Multi-value_ or _Include all value_
options are enabled, Grafana converts the labels from plain text to a regex compatible string. Which means you have to use `=~` instead of `=`.

### Ad hoc filters variable

Prometheus supports the special [ad hoc filters]({{< relref "../variables/variable-types/add-ad-hoc-filters.md" >}}) variable type. It allows you to specify any number of label/value filters on the fly. These filters are automatically
applied to all your Prometheus queries.

## Annotations

[Annotations]({{< relref "../dashboards/annotations.md" >}}) allow you to overlay rich event information on top of graphs. You add annotation
queries via the Dashboard menu / Annotations view.

Prometheus supports two ways to query annotations.

- A regular metric query
- A Prometheus query for pending and firing alerts (for details see [Inspecting alerts during runtime](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#inspecting-alerts-during-runtime))

The step option is useful to limit the number of events returned from your query.

## Get Grafana metrics into Prometheus

Grafana exposes metrics for Prometheus on the `/metrics` endpoint. We also bundle a dashboard within Grafana so you can get started viewing your metrics faster. You can import the bundled dashboard by going to the data source edit page and click the dashboard tab. There you can find a dashboard for Grafana and one for Prometheus. Import and start viewing all the metrics!

For detailed instructions, refer to [Internal Grafana metrics]({{< relref "../administration/view-server/internal-metrics.md">}}).

## Prometheus API

The Prometheus data source works with other projects that implement the [Prometheus query API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) including:

- [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/)
- [Thanos](https://thanos.io/v0.17/components/query.md/)

For more information on how to query other Prometheus-compatible projects from Grafana, refer to the specific project documentation.

## Provision the Prometheus data source

You can configure data sources using config files with Grafana's provisioning system. Read more about how it works and all the settings you can set for data sources on the [provisioning docs page]({{< relref "../administration/provisioning/#datasources" >}}).

Here are some provisioning examples for this data source:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

datasources:
  - name: Prometheus
    type: prometheus
    # Access mode - proxy (server in the UI) or direct (browser in the UI).
    access: proxy
    url: http://localhost:9090
    jsonData:
      httpMethod: POST
      exemplarTraceIdDestinations:
        # Field with internal link pointing to data source in Grafana.
        # datasourceUid value can be anything, but it should be unique across all defined data source uids.
        - datasourceUid: my_jaeger_uid
          name: traceID

        # Field with external link.
        - name: traceID
          url: 'http://localhost:3000/explore?orgId=1&left=%5B%22now-1h%22,%22now%22,%22Jaeger%22,%7B%22query%22:%22$${__value.raw}%22%7D%5D'
```

## Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

The Prometheus data source works with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. If you are using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to control access to your Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus domain, then you must use AWS Signature Version 4 (AWS SigV4) to sign all requests to that domain. For more details on AWS SigV4, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

> **Note:** Grafana version 7.3.5 or higher is required to use SigV4 authentication.

To connect the Prometheus data source to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus using SigV4 authentication, refer to the AWS guide to [Set up Grafana open source or Grafana Enterprise for use with AMP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-query-standalone-grafana.html).

If you are running Grafana in an Amazon EKS cluster, follow the AWS guide to [Query using Grafana running in an Amazon EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-query-grafana-7.3.html).

## Configuring exemplars

> **Note:** This feature is available in Prometheus 2.26+ and Grafana 7.4+.

Grafana 7.4 and later versions have the capability to show exemplars data alongside a metric both in Explore and Dashboards.
Exemplars are a way to associate higher cardinality metadata from a specific event with traditional timeseries data.
