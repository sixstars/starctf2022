# Inspector in Explore

The inspector helps you understand and troubleshoot your queries. You can inspect the raw data, export that data to a comma-separated values (CSV) file, export log results in TXT format, and view query requests.

## Inspector UI

The inspector has following tabs:

- **Stats tab -** Shows how long your query takes and how much it returns.
- **Query tab -** Shows you the requests to the server sent when Grafana queries the data source.
- **JSON tab -** Allows you to view and copy the data JSON and data frame structure JSON.
- **Data tab -** Shows the raw data returned by the query.
- **Error tab -** Shows the error. Only visible when query returns error.
