# Manage variables

The variables page lets you [add]({{< relref "variable-types/_index.md" >}}) variables and manage existing variables. It also allows you to [inspect]({{< relref "inspect-variable.md" >}}) variables and identify whether a variable is being referenced (or used) in other variables or dashboard.

## Move

You can move a variable up or down the list using the up and down arrows respectively.

## Clone

To clone a variable, click the clone icon from the set of icons on the right. This creates a copy of the variable with the name of the original variable prefixed with `copy_of_`.

## Delete

To delete a variable, click the trash icon from the set of icons on the right.
