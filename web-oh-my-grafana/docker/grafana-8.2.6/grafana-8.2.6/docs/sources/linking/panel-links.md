## Add a panel link

1. Hover your cursor over the panel that you want to add a link to and then press `e`. Or click the dropdown arrow next to the panel title and then click **Edit**.
1. On the Panel tab, scroll down to the Links section.
1. Expand Links and then click **Add link**.
1. Enter a **Title**. **Title** is a human-readable label for the link that will be displayed in the UI.
1. Enter the **URL** you want to link to.
   You can even add one of the template variables defined in the dashboard. Press Ctrl+Space or Cmd+Space and click in the **URL** field to see the available variables. By adding template variables to your panel link, the link sends the user to the right context, with the relevant variables already set. You can also use time variables:
   - `from` - Defines the lower limit of the time range, specified in ms epoch.
   - `to` - Defines the upper limit of the time range, specified in ms epoch.
   - `time` and `time.window` - Define a time range from `time-time.window/2` to `time+time.window/2`. Both params should be specified in ms. For example `?time=1500000000000&time.window=10000` will result in 10s time range from 1499999995000 to 1500000005000.
1. If you want the link to open in a new tab, then select **Open in a new tab**.
1. Click **Save** to save changes and close the window.
1. Click **Save** in the upper right to save your changes to the dashboard.
