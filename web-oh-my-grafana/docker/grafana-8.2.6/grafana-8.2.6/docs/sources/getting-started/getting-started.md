# Getting started with Grafana

This topic helps you get started with Grafana and build your first dashboard. To learn more about Grafana, refer to [What is Grafana?]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}).

> **Note:** Grafana also offers a [free account with Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/signup/cloud/connect-account?pg=gsdocs) to help getting started even easier and faster. You can install Grafana to self-host or get a free Grafana Cloud account.

## Step 1: Install Grafana

Grafana can be installed on many different operating systems. For a list of the minimum hardware and software requirements, as well as instructions on installing Grafana, refer to [Install Grafana]({{< relref "../installation/_index.md" >}}).

## Step 2: Log in

To log in to Grafana for the first time:

1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/. The default HTTP port that Grafana listens to is `3000` unless you have configured a different port.
1. On the login page, enter `admin` for username and password.
1. Click **Log in**. If login is successful, then you will see a prompt to change the password.
1. Click **OK** on the prompt, then change your password.

> **Note:** We strongly recommend that you follow Grafana's best practices and change the default administrator password. Don't forget to record your credentials!

## Step 3: Create a dashboard

To create your first dashboard:

1. Click the **+** icon on the side menu.
1. On the dashboard, click **Add an empty panel**.
1. In the New dashboard/Edit panel view, go to the **Query** tab.
1. Configure your [query]({{< relref "../panels/queries.md" >}}) by selecting `-- Grafana --` from the [data source selector]({{< relref "../panels/queries.md/#data-source-selector" >}}). This generates the Random Walk dashboard.
1. Click the **Save** icon in the top right corner of your screen to save the dashboard.
1. Add a descriptive name, and then click **Save**.

Congratulations, you have created your first dashboard and it is displaying results.
