# Apply transformations

You can apply transformations from the Transform tab of the Grafana panel editor, which is located next to the Queries tab. See also, [Debug transformations](#debug-transformations).

To apply a transformation:

1. Navigate to the panel where you want to add one or more transformations.
1. Click the panel title and then click **Edit**.
1. Click the **Transform** tab.
1. Click a transformation to select it.

   A transformation row displays. You can configure the transformation options here. For more information, refer to [Transformation types and options]({{< relref "types-options.md" >}}).

1. Click **Add transformation** to apply another transformation.

   This next transformation acts on the result set returned by the previous transformation.
