# Pause an alert rule

Pausing the evaluation of an alert rule can sometimes be useful. For example, during a maintenance window, pausing alert rules can avoid triggering a flood of alerts.

1. In the Grafana side bar, hover your cursor over the Alerting (bell) icon and then click **Alert Rules**. All configured alert rules are listed, along with their current state.
1. Find your alert in the list, and click the **Pause** icon on the right. The **Pause** icon turns into a **Play** icon.
1. Click the **Play** icon to resume evaluation of your alert.
