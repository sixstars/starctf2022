# Pie chart

{{< figure src="/static/img/docs/pie-chart-panel/pie-chart-example.png" max-width="1200px" lightbox="true" caption="Pie chart visualization" >}}

The pie chart displays reduced series, or values in a series, from one or more queries, as they relate to each other, in the form of slices of a pie. The arc length, area and central angle of a slice are all proportional to the slices value, as it relates to the sum of all values. This type of chart is best used when you want a quick comparison of a small set of values in an aesthetically pleasing form.

## Value options

Use the following options to refine the value in your visualization.

### Show

Choose how much information to show.

- **Calculate -** Reduces each value to a single value per series.
- **All values -** Displays every value from a single series.

### Calculation

Select a calculation to reduce each series when Calculate has been selected. For information about available calculations, refer to the [Calculation list]({{< relref "../panels/calculations-list.md" >}}).

### Limit

When displaying every value from a single series, this limits the number of values displayed.

### Fields

Select which field or fields to display in the visualization. Each field name is available on the list, or you can select one of the following options:

- **Numeric fields -** All fields with numerical values.
- **All fields -** All fields that are not removed by transformations.
- **Time -** All fields with time values.
