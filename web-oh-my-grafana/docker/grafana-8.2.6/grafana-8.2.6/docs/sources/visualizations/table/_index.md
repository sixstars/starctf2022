# Table

The table panel visualization is very flexible, supporting multiple modes for time series and for tables, annotation, and raw JSON data. This panel also provides date formatting, value formatting, and coloring options.

## Annotation support

Annotations are not currently supported in the new table panel. This might be added back in a future release.

## Sort column

Click a column title to change the sort order from default to descending to ascending. Each time you click, the sort order changes to the next option in the cycle. You can only sort by one column at a time.

## Table options

> **Note:** If you are using a table visualization created before Grafana 7.0, then you need to migrate to the new table version in order to see these options. To migrate, on the Panel tab, click **Table** visualization. Grafana updates the table version and you can then access all table options.

### Show header

Show or hide column names imported from your data source.

## Column width

By default, Grafana automatically calculates the column width based on the table size and the minimum column width. This field option can override the setting and define the width for all columns in pixels.

For example, if you enter `100` in the field, then when you click outside the field, all the columns will be set to 100 pixels wide.

## Minimum column width

By default, the minimum width of the table column is 150 pixels. This field option can override that default and will define the new minimum column width for the table panel in pixels.

For example, if you enter `75` in the field, then when you click outside the field, all the columns will scale to no smaller than 75 pixels wide.

For small-screen devices, such as smartphones or tablets, reduce the default `150` pixel value to`50` to allow table based panels to render correctly in dashboards.

## Column alignment

Choose how Grafana should align cell contents:

- Auto (default)
- Left
- Center
- Right

## Cell display mode

By default, Grafana automatically chooses display settings. You can override the settings by choosing one of the following options to change all fields.

> **Note:** If you set these in the Field tab, then the display modes will apply to all fields, including the time field. Many options will work best if you set them in the Override tab.

### Color text

If thresholds are set, then the field text is displayed in the appropriate threshold color.

### Color background (gradient or solid)

If thresholds are set, then the field background is displayed in the appropriate threshold color.

### Gradient gauge

The threshold levels define a gradient.

### LCD gauge

The gauge is split up in small cells that are lit or unlit.

### JSON view

Shows value formatted as code. If a value is an object the JSON view allowing browsing the JSON object will appear on hover.

### Image

> Only available in Grafana 7.3+

If you have a field value that is an image URL or a base64 encoded image you can configure the table to display it as an image.

## Column filter

You can temporarily change how column data is displayed. For example, you can order values from highest to lowest or hide specific values. For more information, refer to [Filter table columns]({{< relref "./filter-table-columns.md" >}}).
