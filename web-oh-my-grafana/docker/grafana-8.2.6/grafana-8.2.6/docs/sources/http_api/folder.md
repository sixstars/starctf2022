# Folder API

## Identifier (id) vs unique identifier (uid)

The identifier (id) of a folder is an auto-incrementing numeric value and is only unique per Grafana install.

The unique identifier (uid) of a folder can be used for uniquely identify folders between multiple Grafana installs. It's automatically generated if not provided when creating a folder. The uid allows having consistent URLs for accessing folders and when syncing folders between multiple Grafana installs. This means that changing the title of a folder will not break any bookmarked links to that folder.

The uid can have a maximum length of 40 characters.

## A note about the General folder

The General folder (id=0) is special and is not part of the Folder API which means
that you cannot use this API for retrieving information about the General folder.

## Get all folders

`GET /api/folders`

Returns all folders that the authenticated user has permission to view. You can control the maximum number of folders returned through the `limit` query parameter, the default is 1000. You can also pass the `page` query parameter for fetching folders from a page other than the first one.

**Example Request**:

```http
GET /api/folders?limit=10 HTTP/1.1

  },
  {
    "id":2,

    "title": "Department RND"

- **title** – The title of the folder.
- **version** – Provide the current version to be able to update the folder. Not needed if `overwrite=true`.

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id":1,
  "uid": "nErXDvCkzz",
  "title": "Department DEF",

  "hasAcl": false,
  "canSave": true,

The **412** status code is used for explaining that you cannot update the folder and why.
There can be different reasons for this:

- The folder has been changed by someone else, `status=version-mismatch`

The response body will have the following properties:

```http
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 97

{
  "message": "The folder has been changed by someone else",
  "status": "version-mismatch"
}
```

## Delete folder

`DELETE /api/folders/:uid`

Deletes an existing folder identified by UID along with all dashboards (and their alerts) stored in the folder. This operation cannot be reverted.

If [Grafana 8 Alerts]({{< relref "../alerting/unified-alerting/_index.md" >}}) are enabled, you can set an optional query parameter `forceDeleteRules=false` so that requests will fail with 400 (Bad Request) error if the folder contains any Grafana 8 Alerts. However, if this parameter is set to `true` then it will delete any Grafana 8 Alerts under this folder.

**Example Request**:

```http
DELETE /api/folders/nErXDvCkzz HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJrIjoiT0tTcG1pUlY2RnVKZTFVaDFsNFZXdE9ZWmNrMkZYbk
