# Reporting API

This API allows you to interact programmatically with the [Reporting]({{< relref "../enterprise/reporting.md" >}}) feature.

> Reporting is only available in Grafana Enterprise. Read more about [Grafana Enterprise]({{< relref "../enterprise" >}}).

> If you have [Fine-grained access Control]({{< relref "../enterprise/access-control/_index.md" >}}) enabled, for some endpoints you would need to have relevant permissions.
> Refer to specific resources to understand what permissions are required.

## Send a report

> Only available in Grafana Enterprise v7.0+.

> This API endpoint is experimental and may be deprecated in a future release. On deprecation, a migration strategy will be provided and the endpoint will remain functional until the next major release of Grafana.

`POST /api/reports/email`

Generate and send a report. This API waits for the report to be generated before returning. We recommend that you set the client's timeout to at least 60 seconds.

#### Required permissions

See note in the [introduction]({{< ref "#reporting-api" >}}) for an explanation.
