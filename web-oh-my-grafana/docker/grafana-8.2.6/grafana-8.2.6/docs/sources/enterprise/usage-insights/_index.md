# Usage insights

Usage insights allow you to have a better understanding of how your Grafana instance is used.

The usage insights feature collects a number of aggregated data and stores them in the database:

- Dashboard views (aggregated and per user)
- Data source errors
- Data source queries

These aggregated data give you access to several features:

- [Dashboard and data source insights]({{< relref "dashboard-datasource-insights.md" >}})
- [Presence indicator]({{< relref "presence-indicator.md" >}})
- [Sort dashboards by using insights data]({{< relref "improved-search.md" >}})

This feature also generates detailed logs that can be exported to Loki. Refer to [Export logs of usage insights]({{< relref "export-logs.md" >}}).
