# Auditing

> **Note:** Only available in Grafana Enterprise v7.3+.

Auditing allows you to track important changes to your Grafana instance. By default, audit logs are logged to file but the auditing feature also supports sending logs directly to Loki.

## Audit logs

Audit logs are JSON objects representing user actions like:

- Modifications to resources such as dashboards and data sources.
- A user failing to log in.

### Format

Audit logs contain the following fields. The fields followed by **\*** are always available, the others depend on the type of action logged.

## Configuration

> **Note:** The auditing feature is disabled by default.

Audit logs can be saved into files, sent to a Loki instance or sent to the Grafana default logger. By default, only the file exporter is enabled.
You can choose which exporter to use in the [configuration file]({{< relref "../administration/configuration.md" >}}).

Options are `file`, `loki`, and `console`. Use spaces to separate multiple modes, such as `file loki`.

By default, when a user creates or updates a dashboard, its content will not appear in the logs as it can significantly increase the size of your logs. If this is important information for you and you can handle the amount of data generated, then you can enable this option in the configuration.

```ini
[auditing]
# Enable the auditing feature
enabled = false
# List of enabled loggers
loggers = file
# Keep dashboard content in the logs (request or response fields); this can significantly increase the size of your logs.
log_dashboard_content = false
```

Each exporter has its own configuration fields.

### File exporter

Audit logs are saved into files. You can configure the folder to use to save these files. Logs are rotated when the file size is exceeded and at the start of a new day.

```ini
[auditing.logs.file]
# Path to logs folder
path = data/log
# Maximum log files to keep
max_files = 5
# Max size in megabytes per log file
max_file_size_mb = 256
```

### Loki exporter

Audit logs are sent to a [Loki](/oss/loki/) service, through HTTP or gRPC.

> The HTTP option for the Loki exporter is only available in Grafana Enterprise v7.4+.

```ini
[auditing.logs.loki]
# Set the communication protocol to use with Loki (can be grpc or http)
type = grpc
# Set the address for writing logs to Loki (format must be host:port)
url = localhost:9095
# Defaults to true. If true, it establishes a secure connection to Loki
tls = true
```

If you have multiple Grafana instances sending logs to the same Loki service or if you are using Loki for non-audit logs, audit logs come with additional labels to help identifying them:

- **host** - OS hostname on which the Grafana instance is running.
- **grafana_instance** - Application URL.
- **kind** - `auditing`

### Console exporter

Audit logs are sent to the Grafana default logger. The audit logs use the `auditing.console` logger and are logged on `debug`-level, learn how to enable debug logging in the [log configuration]({{< relref "../administration/configuration.md#log" >}}) section of the documentation. Accessing the audit logs in this way is not recommended for production use.
