# Grafana Enterprise configuration

This page describes Grafana Enterprise-specific configuration options that you can specify in a `.ini` configuration file or using environment variables. Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../administration/configuration.md" >}}) for more information about available configuration options.

## [enterprise]

### license_path

Local filesystem path to Grafana Enterprise's license file.
Defaults to `<paths.data>/license.jwt`.

### license_text

> **Note:** Available in Grafana Enterprise v7.4+.

When set to the text representation (i.e. content of the license file)
of the license, Grafana will evaluate and apply the given license to
the instance.

### auto_refresh_license

> **Note:** Available in Grafana Enterprise v7.4+.

When enabled, Grafana will send the license and usage statistics to
the license issuer. If the license has been updated on the issuer's
side to be valid for a different number of users or a new duration,
your Grafana instance will be updated with the new terms
automatically. Defaults to `true`.

## [white_labeling]

## [caching]

> **Note:** Available in Grafana Enterprise v7.5 and later versions.

When query caching is enabled, Grafana can temporarily store the results of data source queries and serve cached responses to similar requests.

### backend

The caching backend to use when storing cached queries. Options: `memory`, `redis`, and `memcached`.

The default is `memory`.

### enabled

Setting 'enabled' to `true` allows users to configure query caching for data sources.

This value is `true` by default.

> **Note:** This setting enables the caching feature, but it does not turn on query caching for any data source. To turn on query caching for a data source, update the setting on the data source configuration page. For more information, refer to the [query caching docs]({{< relref "./query-caching.md#enable-and-configure-query-caching" >}}).

### ttl

_Time to live_ (TTL) is the time that a query result is stored in the caching system before it is deleted or refreshed. This setting defines the time to live for query caching, when TTL is not configured in data source settings. The default value is `1m` (1 minute).

### max_ttl

The max duration that a query result is stored in the caching system before it is deleted or refreshed. This value will override `ttl` config option or data source setting if the `ttl` value is greater than `max_ttl`. To disable this constraint, set this value to `0s`.

The default is `0s` (disabled).

> **Note:** Disabling this constraint is not recommended in production environments.

### max_value_mb

This value limits the size of a single cache value. If a cache value (or query result) exceeds this size, then it is not cached. To disable this limit, set this value to `0`.

The default is `1`.

### connection_timeout

This setting defines the duration to wait for a connection to the caching backend.

The default is `5s`.

### read_timeout

This setting defines the duration to wait for the caching backend to return a cached result. To disable this timeout, set this value to `0s`.

The default is `0s` (disabled).

> **Note:** Disabling this timeout is not recommended in production environments.

### write_timeout

This setting defines the number of seconds to wait for the caching backend to store a result. To disable this timeout, set this value to `0s`.

The default is `0s` (disabled).

> **Note:** Disabling this timeout is not recommended in production environments.

## [caching.encryption]

### enabled

When 'enabled' is `true`, query values in the cache are encrypted.

The default is `false`.

### encryption_key

A string used to generate a key for encrypting the cache. For the encrypted cache data to persist between Grafana restarts, you must specify this key. If it is empty when encryption is enabled, then the key is automatically generated on startup, and the cache clears upon restarts.

The default is `""`.

## [caching.memory]

### gc_interval

When storing cache data in-memory, this setting defines how often a background process cleans up stale data from the in-memory cache. More frequent "garbage collection" can keep memory usage from climbing but will increase CPU usage.

The default is `1m`.

### max_size_mb

The maximum size of the in-memory cache in megabytes. Once this size is reached, new cache items are rejected. For more flexible control over cache eviction policies and size, use the Redis or Memcached backend.

To disable the maximum, set this value to `0`.

The default is `25`.

> **Note:** Disabling the maximum is not recommended in production environments.

## [caching.redis]

### url

The full Redis URL of your Redis server. Example: `redis://localhost:6739/0`.

The default is `"redis://localhost:6379"`.

### cluster

A comma-separated list of Redis cluster members in `host:port` format. For example, `localhost:7000, localhost: 7001, localhost:7002`.

> **Note:** If you have specify `cluster`, the value for `url` is ignored.

### prefix

A string that prefixes all Redis keys. This value must be set if using a shared database in Redis. If `prefix` is empty, then one will not be used.

The default is `"grafana"`.

## [caching.memcached]

### memcached_servers

A space-separated list of memcached servers. Example: `memcached-server-1:11211 memcached-server-2:11212 memcached-server-3:11211`. Or if there's only one server: `memcached-server:11211`.

The default is `"localhost:11211"`.
