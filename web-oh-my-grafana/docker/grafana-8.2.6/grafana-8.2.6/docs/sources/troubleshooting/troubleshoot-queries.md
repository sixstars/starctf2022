# Troubleshoot queries

This page provides information to solve common dashboard problems.

## I get different results when I rearrange my functions

Function order is very important. Just like in math, the order that you place your functions can affect the result.

## Inspect your query request and response

The most common problems are related to the query and response from your data source. Even if it looks
like a bug or visualization issue in Grafana, it is almost always a problem with the data source query or
the data source response. Start by inspecting your panel query and response.

For more information, refer to [Inspect a panel]({{< relref "../panels/inspect-panel.md" >}}).

## My query is slow

How many data points is your query returning? A query that returns lots of data points will be slow. Try this:

- In **Query options**, limit the **Max data points** returned.
- In **Query options**, increase the **Min interval** time.
- In your query, use a `group by` function.
