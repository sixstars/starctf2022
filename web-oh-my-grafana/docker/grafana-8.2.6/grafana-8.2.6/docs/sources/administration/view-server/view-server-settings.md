# View Grafana server settings

> Refer to [Fine-grained access control]({{< relref "../../enterprise/access-control/_index.md" >}}) in Grafana Enterprise to understand how you can control access with fine-grained permissions.

If you are a Grafana server administrator, use the Settings tab to view the settings that are applied to your Grafana server via the [Configuration]({{< relref "../configuration.md#config-file-locations" >}}) file and any environmental variables.

> **Note:** Only Grafana server administrators can access the **Server Admin** menu. For more information about about administrative permissions, refer to [Grafana server admin]({{< relref "../../permissions/_index.md" >}}).

## View server settings
