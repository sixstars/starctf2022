# Manage users as an Org Admin

An _organization_ is a group of users on a Grafana server. Each user can belong to more than one organization. Every member of the organization has a _role_ in that organization that grants them a certain level of permissions. For more information, refer to [Organization roles]({{< relref "../../permissions/organization_roles.md" >}}).

Organization Admins, also called Org Admins, can manage users in their organization. Some of their tasks overlap with the [Server Admin tasks]({{< relref "../server-admin/_index.md" >}}).

> **Note:** You must have Admin permissions in an organization in order to perform the tasks described in this page.

## View organization user account list

## Manage organization invitations

Organization Admins can invite users to their Grafana organizations and manage invitations. When an invited user signs in to Grafana, a user account is created for them if one does not already exist.
