# Change the organization you are signed in to

When you sign in to Grafana, you are always signed in with a particular organization. If you are assigned to multiple organizations, then you might need to switch which organization you are signed in to. For example, if you need to view a dashboard associated with a different org, then you might switch organizations.

1. Hover your cursor over your user icon in the lower left corner of the screen, then click **Switch**.
1. Next to the organization that you want to sign in to, click **Switch to**.
