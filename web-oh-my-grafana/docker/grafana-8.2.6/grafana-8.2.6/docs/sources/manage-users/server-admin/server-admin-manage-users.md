# Manage users as a Server Admin

This topic explains user management tasks performed by Grafana Server Admins.

In order to perform any of these tasks, you must be logged in to Grafana on an account with Grafana Server Admin permissions. For more information about Grafana Admin permissions, refer to [Grafana Server Admin role]({{< relref "../../permissions/_index.md#grafana-server-admin-role" >}}).

> **Note:** The Grafana Server Admin role does not exist in Grafana Cloud. Grafana Cloud users cannot perform tasks listed in this section.

## View the server user account list

See a complete list of users with accounts on your Grafana server.

{{< docs/shared "manage-users/view-server-user-list.md" >}}

Grafana displays all user accounts on the server, listed in alphabetical order by user name. The following information is displayed:

- **Login -** The value in the **Username** field of the account.
- **Email -** The email associated with the user account.
- **Name -** The value in the **Name** field of the account.
- **Seen -** How long ago the user logged in. If they have never logged in, then the default longest time (10y) is displayed.
- **Server Admin status -** If the user account has **Grafana Admin** option set, then a shield icon is displayed.
- **Account status -** If the account is disabled, then the **Disabled** label is displayed.
