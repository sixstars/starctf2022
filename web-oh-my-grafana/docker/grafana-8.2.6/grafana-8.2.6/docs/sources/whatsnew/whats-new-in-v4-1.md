### Shared tooltip

{{< figure class="float-right"  max-width="60%" src="/static/img/docs/v41/shared_tooltip.gif" caption="Shared tooltip" >}}

Showing the tooltip on all panels at the same time has been a long standing request in Grafana and we are really happy to finally be able to release it.
You can enable/disable the shared tooltip from the dashboard settings menu or cycle between default, shared tooltip and shared crosshair by pressing Ctrl/Cmd+O.

### Help text for panel

{{< figure class="float-right"  max-width="60%" src="/static/img/docs/v41/helptext_for_panel_settings.png" caption="Hovering help text" >}}

You can set a help text in the general tab on any panel. The help text is using Markdown to enable better formatting and linking to other sites that can provide more information.

{{< figure class="float-right"  max-width="60%" src="/static/img/docs/v41/helptext_hover.png" caption="Hovering help text" >}}

Panels with a help text available have a little indicator in the top left corner. You can show the help text by hovering the icon.

### Easier Cloudwatch configuration

{{< figure class="float-right"  max-width="60%" src="/static/img/docs/v41/cloudwatch_settings.png" caption="Cloudwatch configuration" >}}

In Grafana 4.1.0 you can configure your Cloudwatch data source with `access key` and `secret key` directly in the data source configuration page.
This enables people to use the Cloudwatch data source without having access to the filesystem where Grafana is running.

Once the `access key` and `secret key` have been saved the user will no longer be able to view them.

## Upgrade and Breaking changes
