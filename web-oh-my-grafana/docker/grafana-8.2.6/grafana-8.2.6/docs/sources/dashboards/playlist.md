# Playlist

A playlist displays a list of dashboards that are in a sequence. Use a playlist to build situational awareness or to present your metrics to your team or visitors. Grafana automatically scales dashboards to any resolution, which makes them perfect for big screens. This topic has the following sections:

- [Access, share, and control a playlist](#access-share-and-control-a-playlist)
- [Create a playlist](#create-a-playlist)
- [Edit or delete a playlist](#edit-or-delete-a-playlist)
- [Share a playlist](#share-a-playlist-in-a-view-mode)

## Access, share, and control a playlist

Use the information in this section to access existing playlists. Start and control the display of a playlist using one of the five available modes.

### Access playlist

1. Hover your cursor over Grafana’s side menu.
1. Click **Playlists**. You will see a list of existing playlists.

### Start a playlist

1. [Access](#access-playlist) the playlist page to see a list of existing playlists.
1. Find the playlist you want to start, then click **Start playlist**. The start playlist dialog opens.
1. Select one of the five playlist modes available based on the information in the following table.
1. Click **Start <playlist name>**.

The playlist displays each dashboard for the time specified in the `Interval` field, set when creating or editing a playlist. Once a playlist starts, you can [control](#control-a-playlist) it using the navbar at the top of your screen.
