# Data source permissions

Data source permissions allow you to restrict access for users to query a data source. For each data source there is a permission page that allows you to enable permissions and restrict query permissions to specific users and teams.

> **Note:** Data source permissions are only available in Grafana Enterprise. For more information, refer to [Data source permissions]({{< relref "../enterprise/datasource_permissions.md" >}}) in [Grafana Enterprise]({{< relref "../enterprise" >}}).
